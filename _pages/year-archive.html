This is a very private space to store and record my thoughts and reflections.
The reason I decided to do this is because on social media everyone shows their best side, the carefully PSed pictures, the wonderful life, and gradually everyone stops seeing each other as who they really are. I think people who are willing to come to my personal page must have a sincere interest in me. I don't want the world to be a place where people always get along with each other with masks, and I can't change how the world works, so my plan is to start with myself.

{% include base_path %}
{% capture written_year %}'None'{% endcapture %}
{% for post in site.posts %}
  {% capture year %}{{ post.date | date: '%Y' }}{% endcapture %}
  {% if year != written_year %}
    <h2 id="{{ year | slugify }}" class="archive__subtitle">{{ year }}</h2>
    {% capture written_year %}{{ year }}{% endcapture %}
  {% endif %}
  {% include archive-single.html %}
{% endfor %}
