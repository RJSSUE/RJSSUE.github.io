This hackathon project enabled multiple users and multiple devices of the same user to collaborate on the annotation of the machine learning studio at Instabase. When a person clicks on a field, the field would be locked and other people can't modify the field, but they can manually kick the user out by hovering over and clicking "x" on the top right. We display the users on the same file at the file list on the left side, and the users on the same dataset at the topbar, by clicking the avatar you can jump to the file that the user is currently viewing. We also enable live chat on each field.
