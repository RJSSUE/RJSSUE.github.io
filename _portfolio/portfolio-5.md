This project implemented the functionality to resize the k8s cluster with Control Plane. This feature made life easier for clients to resize their resource, embedded strict type-checking with drop-down lists and input boxes to prevent users from entering bad patches to the pods, also enabled resizing requests at scale and all at once.
