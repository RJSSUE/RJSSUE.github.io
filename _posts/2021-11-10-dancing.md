Apart from the coursework, I really enjoy street dancing and have been participating in dance clubs and taking part in performances and dance competitions. (Dance is a very inclusive sport, where everyone, no matter how tall or short, fat or thin, can show their beauty, have their own style, express themselves freely and reap the joy.)
